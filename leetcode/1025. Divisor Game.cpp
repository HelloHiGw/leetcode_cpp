/*
Mathematical Induction Prove （Bottom-up)
N = 1, lose directly
N = 2, will win choosing x = 1.
N = 3, must lose choosing x = 1.
N = 4, will win choosing x = 1.
....

For N <= n, we have find that:
If N is even, can win.
If N is odd, will lose.

For the case N = n + 1
If N is even, we can win choosing x = 1,
give the opponent an odd number N - 1 = n,
force him to lose,
because we have found that all odd N <= n will lose.

If N is odd, there is no even x that N % x == 0.
As a result, we give the opponent a even number N - x,
and the opponent can win,
because we have found that all even N <= n can win.

Now we prove that, for all N <= n,
If N is even, can win.
If N is odd, will lose.
